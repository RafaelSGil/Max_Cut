# Max Cut

Solution for the Max Cut Problem

## Problem description

Find a maximum cut for a given undirected graph G(V, E), with n vertices and m edges. A
maximum cut of G is a partition of the graph's vertices into two complementary sets S and T, such
that the number of edges between the set S and the set T is as large as possible.
